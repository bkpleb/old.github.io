   My journey in life has and will always be non-linear.
            
   Since a young age, I've always been an explorer and risk-taker. Finding joy in how things work has allowed me to view the functions of the world as systems. After all, everything is a system but what's difficult is how to dissect it
   in order to make use of it for yourself.

   My first introduction to technology would be when I recieved an EV3 robotics kit when I was 8 years old. This lead to learning programming throughout primary school. During middle school years, I spent a lot of time doing competitive
   programming. High level abstractions are always very tricky, it takes strong fundamentals and time to fully grasp such concepts.
