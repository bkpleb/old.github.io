   My journey in life has and will always be non-linear.
            
   Since a young age, I've always been an explorer and risk-taker. Finding joy in how things work has allowed me to view the functions of the world as systems. After all, everything is a system but what's difficult is how to dissect it
   in order to make use of it for yourself.

   My first introduction to technology would be when I recieved an EV3 robotics kit.
