   My journey in life has and will always be non-linear.
            
   Since a young age, I've always been an explorer and risk-taker. Finding joy in how things work has allowed me to view the functions of the world as systems. After all, everything is a system but what's difficult is how to dissect it
   in order to make use of it for yourself.

   My first introduction to technology would be when I recieved an EV3 robotics kit when I was 8 years old. This lead to learning programming throughout primary school. During middle school years, I spent a lot of time doing competitive
   programming. I lost huge portions of brain cells trying to understand the contents of <i>The Algorithm Design Manual</i>. High level abstractions are always very tricky, it takes strong fundamentals and time to fully grasp such concepts. 
   
   When I was freshman in high school, I started taking a deep interest in political science and economics. The works of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek deeply influenced me. During my spare time I would read economic journals,
   listen to very old recordings and get my hands on anything I could find. In junior year, I got into cybersecurity after doing my first CTF and did some vulnerability disclosure programs on HackerOne. Around the same year, I got into 
   Bitcoin and Lightning Network (starting running a LN node). Now I'm focusing on defi and blockchain infrastructure & ecosystems.                  
   
   You may be wondering what subject/industry/area I really like and wish to pursue. Honestly, I don't know. I don't think I will be focusing on just one area but multiple areas and work in a role that's interdisciplinary.
   Personally, it doesn't matter how you get to a destination but where you want to go. Many focus on the former, thinking too far into the future with no clue of external factors that can change the course of your life in its entirety.
            
   I aspire to contribute in the development of new financial systems and participate the Olympics as a fencer (foilist) representing Australia.
