## Firefox 
I was an [NDA'd contributor](https://wiki.mozilla.org/NDA) at Mozilla for 2 years where I did knowledge base writing and support (was [Social Support Moderator](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-be-social-support-moderator)). Some may say I'm mentally ill but don't worry. I like what I do. For the entire list of docs, visit [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/user/VintageMind/documents).
